# relaxation

Week 1:
For week 1 I have done a lot of research on the project and some html writing. 
My research includes what calms down people when they're angry, sad or stressed. I also looked at what makes people feel that way and how they can avoid it. The HTML I wrote is for the first button that someone will click when they're angry. When I add the javascript the user will only be able to see one action at a time.
