<p>Where should a 500 pound alien go? On a diet.</p>
<p>What did the laundryman say to the impatient customer? Keep your shirt on!</p>
<p>What's the difference between a TV and a newspaper? Ever tried swatting a fly with a TV?</p>
<p>What is green and has yellow wheels? Grass, I lied about the wheels!</p>
<p>How do you cure a headache? Put your head through a window and the pane will just disappear.</p>
<p>What is the stupidest animal in the jungle? The polar bear.</p>
<p>Two mice chewing on a film roll. One of them goes: "I think the book was better."</p>
<p>My grandfather had the heart of a lion and a lifetime ban from the New York City Zoo.</p>
<p>I remember the last thing my grandpa said before he kicked the bucket. He said "Hey, how do you think I can kick this bucket?"</p>
<p>Knock Knock. Who's there? Europe. Europe Who? No you're a poo!</p>
<p>And the lord said unto John "Come forth and you shall receive eternal life." John came fifth and won a toaster.</p>

<h2>Let's be mindful</h2>
<p>Being mindful means being aware of your body and mind. What is your body doing? Focus on every muscle from your toes to your head. What do you feel? Are any of your muscles tight? Contract and them relax them. If you aren't already, get comfortable. Do whatever makes you feel best. Are you breathing quickly? Try to slow it down. Take as much time as you can to breathe. <br>Now take a moment to focus on your thoughts. What is your emotional state? Now take three slow breaths. What is your next thought?<br>
Hug yourself tightly and then stretch out all the muscles you can. Reach up as high as your can. Now relax and just breathe. That's all you have to do. There are no obligations or expectations. Just breathe.</p>
<button id="angry5a">I'm Finished</button>

<!--SAD STARTS HERE!-->
<div class="sad2">
<p>Why are you sad? What else are you feeling? Let out all of your thoughts.</p>
<textarea cols=100 rows=15></textarea>
<br>
<button id="sad2a">Move on</button>
</div>

<div class="sad3">
<p>Now imagine letting go of all of those feelings. Cry or scream, if you'd like. Release those feelings from your mind. Any sadness or anxiety you've been feeling doesn't exist in this moment.</p>
<p>Repeat one of these statements three times
  <ul>
    <li>"I can survive this."</li>
    <li>"This situation is temporary."</li>
    <li>"My life is just beginning."</li>
    <li>"I am beautiful, I am smart, and I am worth it."</li>
    <li>"I am a powerhouse; I am indestructible."</li>
    <li>"Happiness is a choice. I can choose to be happy."</li>
