<h2>Let's be mindful</h2>
<p>Being mindful means being aware of your body and mind. What is your body doing? Focus on every muscle from your toes to your head. What do you feel? Are any of your muscles tight? Contract and them relax them. If you aren't already, get comfortable. Do whatever makes you feel best. Are you breathing quickly? Try to slow it down. Take as much time as you can to breathe. <br>Now take a moment to focus on your thoughts. What is your emotional state? Now take three slow breaths. What is your next thought?<br>
Hug yourself tightly and then stretch out all the muscles you can. Reach up as high as your can. Now relax and just breathe. That's all you have to do. There are no obligations or expectations. Just breathe.</p>

<div class="sad3">
  <p>Thank you. Your feelings are important and valid, no matter how ridiculous they might seem to others.<p>
  <p>Studies show that writing down what you're feeling helps understand those feelings and get rid of them.</p>

<div class="sad4">
<p>Now imagine letting go of all of those feelings. Cry or scream, if you'd like. Release those feelings from your mind. Any sadness or anxiety you've been feeling doesn't exist in this moment.</p>
<p>Repeat one of these statements three times
  <ul>
    <li>"I can survive this."</li>

  <h2>You are not alone</h2>

<h2>Thank you for participating</h2>
<p>Young adults have to deal with these feelings every day, escpecially stress.</p>
<p> Other ways to relieve these feelings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>talking it out with someone</li>
    <li>exercising</li>
    <li>meditating</li>
    <li>seeing something funny or silly</li>
    <li>spending time with a friend or pet</li>
    <li>listening to music </li>
    <li>maintaing a healthy lifestyle</li>
</ul>
<p>There are unhealthy ways to deal with these feelings such as taking it out on other people, drinking or doing drugs, and binge eating. Try to stay away from those. They don't really help the problem.</p>
<p>Do not try to hide your feelings from everyone. Find someone you trust and talk to them about it. If you find that your feelings are impossible to deal with or seem unhealthy, you should consult a doctor. </p>
